# TkMineSweeper

This is a simple game of Minesweeper done with the Pythons
built-in GUI tkinter. It uses "settings.txt" as a tool to
configure between different options available. The game is
inspired by the original Microsoft's Minesweeper.

Any modification done to the "settings.txt" file outside the
software may end up causing an error. Software deals with any
of those errors accordingly.

For detailed info about the software see: Instructions.txt or inside
the program use sub-menu "About" --> "Instructions".
